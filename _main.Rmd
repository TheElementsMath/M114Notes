This textbook has been prepared as a companion resource for students enrolled in Business Mathematics at Okanagan College. It is designed to support, not replace, the lecture material delivered in class. While every effort has been made to ensure that the content presented here is accurate and helpful, students are reminded that this resource is not a comprehensive or final source of information. Instead, it should be used alongside classroom instruction, assigned readings, and, most importantly, the official textbook: Business Mathematics by Hobart.

The material in this book covers a broad range of fundamental topics essential to understanding and applying mathematics in a business context. Beginning with a review of basic algebra, the book develops the mathematical skills needed to approach problems in supply and demand economics, cost-volume-profit (CVP) analysis, and merchandising. As students progress, they will explore the time value of money, including calculations involving both simple and compound interest. From there, the book moves into more advanced financial topics such as annuities and mortgages, offering step-by-step procedures and practical examples to illustrate how these concepts apply in real-world business settings.

Each section is written with the aim of being accessible and clear. Wherever possible, examples are contextualized within realistic business scenarios to help students understand not just how to perform calculations, but why they matter in decision-making processes. Practice problems are provided throughout to reinforce learning and encourage independent problem-solving.

Despite the care taken in preparing this resource, students are cautioned that this document may contain errors or omissions. It is not a substitute for professional instruction, nor should it be considered an authoritative source on its own. The official course textbook remains the primary source for course content and should be consulted regularly.

This resource is offered in the spirit of academic support. It is our hope that it will help students build confidence, develop analytical skills, and better understand the mathematical foundations of business decision-making.

###  Lecture Notes: {-}

Lecture material for this class come from Sections 1.6 and can be found below.  This material is considered review material and so it is not covered in depth.


1. **Video: [Percentages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU3i-S4sxdw)**  
**Video: [Ratios](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj1cYFE7cBA)**  
**Video: [Proportions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4TboDA7cNI)**  
Ratios are used to compare multiple quantities.  They can be expressed: (a) using a colon, (b) as a fraction, (c) as a decimal, and (d) as a percentage.
   * **Ratios:** A comparison between two quantities using division.  
    Example: A ratio of 3 to 2 can be written as \( 3:2 \), \( \frac{3}{2} \), or "3 to 2".
   *  **Rates:** A specific type of ratio comparing quantities with different units.  
    Example: A car travels 60 miles in 2 hours, so the rate is \( \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \).
   *  **Fractions:** Express part of a whole as a ratio of two numbers (numerator and denominator).  
    Example: \( \frac{1}{4} \) means 1 part out of 4 equal parts.
   *  **Percentages:** A fraction with a denominator of 100. Expresses how many parts out of 100.  
    Example: \( 25\% = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   *  **Decimals:** A way of expressing fractions and percentages using powers of 10.  
    Example: \( 0.5 = \frac{1}{2} = 50\% \)<br><br>


2. **Video: [Taxes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9YKlxowu68)**   
**Video: [Exchange Rates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChgppEgOYc0)**  
Ratios, rates and proportions have many different applications. They allow us to compare quantities, scale values, and interpret data in meaningful ways.
   * **Ratios in Simplest Integer Form:**  In many contexts, we prefer to express ratios using whole numbers for simplicity and clarity.  
       * Example: A recipe that uses 2 parts sugar to 3 parts flour can be written as the ratio $2:3$.
   * **Ratios with a term of 1:**  It is often helpful to express a ratio with one of the terms as 1 to make comparisons easier.  
       * Example: If the ratio of students to teachers is \( 24:1 \), it means there are 24 students per teacher.
   * **Multiple Ratios or Rates in One Situation:**  Some problems involve more than two quantities or rates that must be compared simultaneously.  
       * Example: A mixture of paint may require a ratio of red : blue : white = \( 3:2:5 \).  
       * In finance, one might compare exchange rates between three currencies: USD to EUR, EUR to GBP, and USD to GBP.
   * **Real-World Applications:** Currency, Tax, and Conversions: Ratios and rates are commonly used in practical calculations such as:
       * Exchange Rates: Converting currencies (e.g., \( 1 \text{ USD} = 0.92 \text{ EUR} \)).
       * Taxes and Discounts: Applying percentage increases or decreases to prices (e.g., adding 15\% tax, taking off 20\% discount).
       * Unit Conversions: Converting between units using rates (e.g., \( 1 \text{ inch} = 2.54 \text{ cm} \)). <br><br>

###  Lecture Notes: {-}

Lecture material for this class come from Section 2.2 and can be found below.  This material is considered review material and so it is not covered in depth.


1. There are several assumptions that are typically made in a perfectly competitive microeconomic market.
   *  **Rational Behavior:** Individuals are rational and aim to maximize their utility or profit.
	 *  **Profit Maximization:** Firms choose output levels to maximize profit, typically where marginal cost equals marginal revenue.
    	 * Perfect Information: All agents have full and accurate information for decision-making.
    	 * Ceteris Paribus: All other factors are held constant when analyzing a change in one variable.
    	 * Perfect Competition: Many buyers and sellers, identical products, no market power, and free market entry/exit.    
	 *  **No Externalities:** All costs and benefits are internal to market participants; no spillover effects. <br><br>
2. **Video: [The Basics of the Supply Curve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKvrbOq1OfI&list=PL-uRhZ_p-BM49QD09RNNJItpiiMGP4GUI&index=2)**  
   *  **Upward Sloping:** The supply curve generally slopes upward, indicating that higher prices incentivize producers to supply more.
	 *  **Movement Along the Curve:** Caused by a change in the price of the good itself. This reflects a change in quantity supplied.
	 *  **Short Run vs. Long Run:** In the short run, some inputs are fixed; in the long run, all inputs are variable, leading to a potentially more elastic supply.  <br><br>
3. **Video: [The Basics of the Demand Curve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUPm2tMCbGE&list=PL-uRhZ_p-BM49QD09RNNJItpiiMGP4GUI)**  
   *  **Downward Sloping:** The demand curve typically slopes downward, indicating that as the price of a good decreases, the quantity demanded increases.
   *  **Movement Along the Curve:** Caused by a change in the price of the good itself. This reflects a change in quantity demanded, not demand.  <br><br>
4. **Video: [Excesses and Surplusses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eZcPs9z9OA)**  
   *  **Shortage (Excess Demand):** Occurs when the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied at a given price.    
	 *  **Caused by Price Below Equilibrium:** If the market price is set below the equilibrium price, demand increases and supply decreases, creating a shortage.    
	 *  **Upward Pressure on Price:** In a shortage, consumers compete for limited goods, pushing prices upward toward equilibrium.
	 *  **Surplus (Excess Supply):** Occurs when the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded at a given price.
	 *  **Caused by Price Above Equilibrium:** If the market price is set above the equilibrium price, supply increases and demand decreases, creating a surplus.
	 *  **Downward Pressure on Price:** In a surplus, sellers lower prices to clear excess inventory, moving the market toward equilibrium.
	 *  **Market Forces Restore Equilibrium:** In a competitive market, shortages and surpluses are typically temporary, as price adjustments lead the market back to equilibrium.  <br><br>
5. **Video: [Equilibrium Price and Quantity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eZcPs9z9OA&list=PL-uRhZ_p-BM49QD09RNNJItpiiMGP4GUI&index=3)**  
**Video: [Shocks to Equilibrium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dwSIO_Slhc)**  
   *  **Shift vs. Movement:** A shift refers to a change in the entire supply or demand curve, while a movement refers to a change along the curve due to a price change.
   *  **Demand Curve Shifts:** Occur when a non-price determinant of demand changes. These include:
       *  Income: Increases in income shift the demand for normal goods right and for inferior goods left.
       *  Prices of Related Goods:
          * Substitutes: An increase in the price of one increases demand for the other.
          * Complements: An increase in the price of one decreases demand for the other.
       * Tastes and Preferences: Favorable changes shift demand right.
       * Expectations: Expectations of future price increases can raise current demand.
       * Number of Buyers: More buyers increase market demand.
   *  **Supply Curve Shifts:** Occur when a non-price determinant of supply changes. These include:
       * Input Prices: Lower input costs shift supply right; higher costs shift it left.
       * Technology: Improvements shift supply right by increasing efficiency.
       * Expectations: If future prices are expected to rise, current supply may decrease.
       * Number of Sellers: More sellers shift supply right.
       * Government Policies: Taxes, subsidies, and regulations can shift supply.
   *  **Effect on Equilibrium:** 
       * Demand Increase: Raises equilibrium price and quantity.
       * Demand Decrease: Lowers equilibrium price and quantity.
       * Supply Increase: Lowers equilibrium price and raises quantity.
       * Supply Decrease: Raises equilibrium price and lowers quantity. <br><br>

###  Lecture Notes: {-}

Lecture material for this class come from Section 3.2 and can be found below.  This material is considered review material and so it is not covered in depth.


1. **Video: [Trade Discounts](https://youtu.be/NBrUqBwk5sE)**  
The net price is the result of reducing the list price by the trade discount.
   * **List Price (Marked Price):**   The original price of a product before any discounts are applied. This is the price set by the manufacturer or seller.
   *  **Trade Discount:**   A percentage reduction from the list price offered by the seller to buyers, often based on quantities purchased or buyer relationships. It is not usually recorded in the books.
   *  **Net Price:**   The actual amount the buyer pays after the trade discount is applied. It is calculated as:
    \[ \text{Net Price} = \text{List Price} \times (1 - \text{Trade Discount}) \]  <br><br>
2. **Video: [Markups](https://youtu.be/IXx3Ix2rr8Y)**  
To ensure the business covers its operating expenses and earns a profit, it adds a markup to the cost.
   * **Cost:**  The total expenditure incurred in producing or purchasing a product. This includes materials, labor, and other direct expenses.
   * **Markup:**  The amount added to the cost to determine the selling price. Markup covers both profit and overhead (indirect costs such as rent, utilities, administrative expenses).
       * **Overhead:** Indirect costs of operating the business, not directly tied to a specific product.
       * **Profit:** The financial gain remaining after all expenses have been covered.
	     * Markup is given by: \[ \text{Markup} = \text{Overhead} + \text{Profit}.\]
   * **Selling Price:** The final price at which the product is sold to customers. It includes both the cost and the markup. It can be expressed as:
    \begin{align*}
    \text{Selling Price} &= \text{Cost} + \text{Markup}\\
    \text{Selling Price} &= \text{Cost} + \text{Overhead} + \text{Profit}.
    \end{align*} <br><br>
3. **Video: [Markdowns](https://youtu.be/GfI57rP47R4)**  
The sale price is a reduced form of the selling price, directly influenced by the markdown rate.  
   * **Rate of Markdown:** The percentage reduction applied to the selling price to encourage sales, clear inventory, or match competition. It is usually expressed as a percentage:
    \[
    \text{Rate of Markdown} = \frac{\text{Selling Price} - \text{Sale Price}}{\text{Selling Price}} \times 100\%
    \]
   *  **Sale Price:** The final price paid by the customer after the markdown is applied. It can be calculated as:
    \[
    \text{Sale Price} = \text{Selling Price} \times (1 - \text{Markdown Rate})
    \]  <br><br>
5. Markup on Cost vs. Gross Profit Margin. 
   *  **Rate of Markup on Cost:**  This measures the percentage increase from the cost price to the selling price. It tells how much profit is made based on the cost of the item. The formula is:
    \[
    \text{Markup Rate (on Cost)} = \frac{\text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost}}{\text{Cost}} \times 100\%
    \]
   *  **Gross Profit Margin (Rate of Markup on Selling Price):**  This measures the profit as a percentage of the selling price. It reflects how much of each dollar of sales is profit before deducting operating expenses. The formula is:
    \[
    \text{Gross Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost}}{\text{Selling Price}} \times 100\%
    \]
   * Key Difference:
       * The markup rate is based on the cost, while the gross profit margin is based on the selling price.
       * For the same product, the markup rate will always be higher than the gross profit margin.

Lecture material for this class come from Sections 3.3 and can be found below.  This material is considered review material and so it is not covered in depth.


1. **Video: [Profit Functions](https://youtu.be/c5i7FsLeDk8)**
   *  **Fixed Costs (FC):** Fixed costs are costs that do not change with output.
	 *  **Total Variable Costs (TVC):** Total variable costs are costs that change as output changes.
	 *  **Variable Costs Per Unit (VC):** Variable costs per unit are the amount that costs increase when we increase output by 1 unit.
	 *  **Total Costs (TC):** The sum of fixed costs and variable costs \[ \text{Total Cost} = FC + TVC\]
	 *  **Profit Function:**
	    \begin{align*}
    \text{Profit} &= \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \\
	&= (P \cdot Q) - (FC + TVC)\\
	&= P \cdot Q - VC \cdot Q - FC\\
	&= (P-VC) \cdot Q - FC
    \end{align*}
    where \( P \) = price per unit, \( Q \) = quantity sold, \( FC \) = fixed costs,  \( VC \) = variable cost per unit, and \( TVC \) = total variable costs. <br><br>
2. **Video: [Contribution Margin/ Rate](https://youtu.be/RMwndvVD894)**  
      * **Contribution Margin:**  The amount each unit contributes to covering fixed costs and generating profit.
    \[
    \text{Contribution Margin} = P - VC
    \]
      *  **Contribution Rate (or Ratio):** The proportion of each sales dollar that contributes to covering fixed costs and profit.
    \[
    \text{Contribution Rate} = \frac{P - VC}{P} = \frac{\text{Contribution Margin}}{\text{Selling Price}}
    \]  <br><br>
3. **Video: [Break-even Point](https://youtu.be/td4Veo3q4r4)**  
      * The level of output at which total revenue equals total costs (i.e., profit is zero): 
    \[
    \text{Break-even Quantity} = \frac{FC}{\text{Contribution Margin per Unit}}
    \] <br><br>
4. The shutdown point is the output level where the contribution margin is 0.  The level of output where price equals the variable cost per unit (VC). If price falls below VC, the firm should shut down in the short run. 
    \[
    \text{Shutdown Point: } CM < 0
    \]
    \[
    \text{Shutdown Point: } P < VC

Lecture material for this class come from Sections 3.1 and 3.4 and can be found below.  This material is considered review material and so it is not covered in depth.


1. **Video: [Derivatives of Polynomials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Sv6CNuNwqo)**  
The derivative of a polynomial function gives the rate of change or slope at any point.
   * Power Rule: If \( f(x) = ax^n \), then \( f'(x) = anx^{n-1} \).
   * Example:  
        \[
        \text{If } f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^2 + 5x - 7, \quad \text{then } f'(x) = 12x^3 - 4x + 5
        \]
   * Derivatives help identify turning points, increasing/decreasing intervals, and points of inflection. <br><br>

2. **Video: [Polynomial Optimization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9M6kmgSnw8)**  
   * Optimization involves finding the maximum or minimum values of a polynomial function by identifying critical points.
   * Critical points occur where \( f'(x) = 0 \) or is undefined. <br><br>

3. **Video: [What is a Monopoly?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=146O2tCFBWs)**  
   * A monopoly is a market structure where a single firm is the sole producer of a good or service.
   * Assumptions of a monopoly:
      * Single seller with full control over supply.
      * No close substitutes for the product.
      * High barriers to entry (legal, technological, or resource-based).
      * Price maker — the firm can influence the market price by adjusting output.
   * Monopolies typically face a downward-sloping demand curve. <br><br>

4. **Video: [Profit Maximization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk8QdpJovfs)**  
   * A monopoly maximizes profit where marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC) or when the derivative of the profit function is 0.
   * Since the monopolist faces a downward-sloping demand curve, \( MR < P \).
   * Profit-maximizing output \( Q^* \) is found where:
        \[
        MR(Q^*) = MC(Q^*)
        \] or where
        \[
        \text{Profit}^{\prime} = 0
        \]	
   * Price is determined by plugging \( Q^* \) into the demand function.
   * For linear demand, profit is calculated as:
        \[
        \text{Profit} = (P - VC) \times Q^* - FC
        \] <br><br>

          * The profit function.
          * The derivative of the profit function.
          * The profit-maximizing output level \( Q^* \).
          * The corresponding price \( P^* \).
          * The maximum profit.

1. **Video: [Calculating Equivalent Payments](https://youtu.be/eCy0_cPgobc)**  
A **payment stream** is a series of individual payments made at different points in time.  
   * Each payment earns interest independently from the time it is deposited until the calculation date (e.g., present or future).
   * To find the \textbf{total future value} or \textbf{present value} of a payment stream:
      * Calculate the future/present value of each payment separately.
      * Add the individual values to find the total.
   * Timeline diagrams are helpful for visualizing and organizing the timing of each payment. <br><br>
2. **Video: [Applications of SI](https://youtu.be/0v4t_Xp7tGo)**  
Two payments are said to be **equivalent**  if they have the same value at the same point in time, considering the effect of interest.
   * To compare payments made at different times:
      * Bring both payments to the same date (using present or future value formulas).
      * Use \( FV = P(1 + rt) \) or \( P = \frac{FV}{1 + rt} \).
   * Equivalent payments are used to replace one payment with another while maintaining the same economic value.  <br><br>
3. Changing interest rates: In real-world scenarios, the interest rate may change during the investment or loan period.
   * For simple interest, calculate interest in segments:
      * Break the time into periods where each rate applies.
      * Apply simple interest separately for each period.
      * Sum the interest amounts to get the total interest.
   * Formula for each segment: \( I = Prt \)
   * Final amount: 
    \[
    FV = P + I_1 + I_2 + \ldots + I_n
    \] <br><br>

1. **Video: [Equivalent Payments and Payment Streams](https://youtu.be/HLUDkVUHNwM)**  
A **payment stream** is a series of cash flows (payments or deposits) made at regular or irregular intervals over time. These are often used in loan payments, investments, or savings plans. 
   * Each payment may earn interest depending on when it is made and when it is evaluated.
   * Time diagrams are useful for visualizing and organizing payment streams.
   * Payment streams can be evaluated using the concept of future value or present value by summing each individual amount's value at the chosen focal date. <br><br>
2. **Equivalent payments** are payments made at different times that have the same value when brought to a common point in time using interest calculations.
   * Payments are equivalent if their present or future values are equal at a given focal date.
   * Used to simplify or compare payment schedules.
Steps:
   * Choose a focal date.
   * Convert each payment to its value at the focal date using simple or compound interest.
   * Equate values and solve for unknowns (e.g., payment amount, date, interest rate).
<br><br>
3. In some financial problems, the interest rate changes at specific intervals during the term of the investment or loan.  
Approach:
   * Split the time period into segments where each rate applies.
   * Apply the interest formula separately for each segment.
   * Use the output of one period as the input (principal) for the next.
Formula:
\[
FV = PV \cdot (1 + i_1)^{n_1} \cdot (1 + i_2)^{n_2} \cdots (1 + i_k)^{n_k}
\]
Where:
   * \( i_k \) is the periodic interest rate during segment \( k \)
   * \( n_k \) is the number of periods for rate \( i_k \)
4. The \textcolor{red}{Continuous compounding} assumes interest is being added at every possible instant. It represents the mathematical limit of compounding frequency.
Formula:
\[
FV = PV \cdot e^{rt}
\]
Where:
   * \( e \approx 2.71828 \) is Euler's number
   * \( r \) is the annual nominal interest rate (in decimal)
   * \( t \) is time in years

1. **Video: [Ordinary Simple Annuities](https://youtu.be/QSn8-A0wNZo)**  
An **ordinary simple annuity** is a series of equal payments made at regular intervals, where:
   * Payments are made at the end of each period.
   * Interest is calculated using simple interest or consistent compound interest rates.  <br><br>
2. **Video: [Present Value and Future Value](https://youtu.be/UGp2LF-J0Mo)**  
The present value (PV) and future value (FV) of an ordinary annuity are given by:
    \[
    PV = PMT \left( \frac{1 - (1 + i)^{-n}}{i} \right)
    \]
    \[
    FV = PMT \left( \frac{(1 + i)^n - 1}{i} \right)
    \] where:
   * \( PMT \): periodic payment
   * \( i = \frac{r}{m} \): interest rate per period
   * \( n = m \cdot t \): total number of payments
   * Used to find the accumulated value of all payments at the beginning or end of the term. <br><br>
3. Steps for Solving Annuity Problems:
   * Identify whether you're solving for FV or PV.
   * Determine \( PMT \), \( r \), \( m \), \( t \), and calculate \( i \) and \( n \).
   * Substitute known values into the appropriate formula.
   * Solve using a calculator or algebraically.
Assumptions:
   * Interest rate remains constant over the term.
   * Payments are equal and made at regular intervals.
   * Compounding matches the payment frequency.  <br><br>

5. **Video: [Calculating $PMT$](https://youtu.be/WV62y3hfJm03)**  
When the PV or FV of an annuity is known, you can calculate the PMT using the formulas below.
When **Future Value** is known:
    \[
    PMT = \frac{FV \cdot i}{(1 + i)^n - 1}
    \]
When **Present Value** is known:
    \[
    PMT = \frac{PV \cdot i}{1 - (1 + i)^{-n}}
    \]  <br><br>
2. **Video: [Calculating $n$](https://youtu.be/K-wqThNzu2A)**  
When the PV or FV of an annuity is known, you can calculate the $n$ using the formulas below.
When **Future Value** is known:
    \[
    n = \frac{\ln\left(\frac{FV \cdot i}{PMT} + 1\right)}{\ln(1 + i)}
    \]
When **Present Value** is known:
    \[
    n = \frac{-\ln\left(1-\frac{i \cdot PV}{PMT}\right)}{\ln(1 + i)}
    \]
   * \(i\) is the periodic interest rate: \( i = \frac{r}{m} \), where \(r\) is the annual nominal interest rate, and \(m\) is the number of compounding periods per year.
   * \(n\) is the total number of payments: \( n = \text{years} \times m \)

1. **Video: [Equivalent Rates](https://youtu.be/-m7XgzLWk2g)**  
An **equivalent interest rate** is a rate that gives the same future value as another rate but is compounded at a different frequency. An equivalent periodic interest rate is given by \( i_2 = \left(1 + i_1\right)^{m_1/m_2} - 1 \).  <br><br>
2. **Video: [Ordinary General Annuities](https://youtu.be/8KY9aTEcZog)**  
An **ordinary general annuity** is a financial arrangement where equal payments (PMTs) are made at the end of each period, but the payment period and the interest compounding period do not match.
   * Payments are made at the end of each payment interval.
   * The payment interval differs from the interest conversion period.
   * The interest rate must be converted to match the payment frequency.  
Key definitions:  
      * \( i_1 \): interest rate per compounding period
      * \( m_1 \): number of compounding periods per year
      * \( m_2 \): number of payment periods per year
      * \( i_1 = \frac{rate}{m_1} \): interest rate per compounding period
      * \( i_2 = \left(1 + i_1\right)^{m_1/m_2} - 1 \): \textbf{equivalent rate per payment period}
      * \( n \): total number of payments
      * \( \text{PMT} \): periodic payment  <br><br>
3. Steps to Solve General Annuity Problems
   * Identify the nominal annual rate \( i_1 \), compounding frequency \( m_1 \), and payment frequency \( m_2 \).
   * Compute the interest per compounding period: \( i_1 = \frac{rate}{m_1} \).
   * Convert \( i_2 \) to an equivalent payment period rate \( i_2 = \left(1 + i_1 \right)^{m_1/m_2} - 1 \).
   * Determine total number of payments \( n = \text{years} \times m_2 \).
   * Apply appropriate formula (FV or PV).  <br><br>

###  Lecture Notes: {-}

Lecture material for this class come from Sections 7.1 and can be found below.  This material is considered review material and so it is not covered in depth.


1. **Video: [Ordinary Annuities Due](https://youtu.be/xalP41MWGSg)**  
An **annuity due** is a series of equal payments made at the beginning of each period, rather than at the end (as in an ordinary annuity). This type of annuity is common in situations like rent, lease payments, and insurance premiums. <br><br>
2. **Video: [General Annuities Due](https://youtu.be/knuOJ03sshA)**  
Future Value of an Annuity Due
\[
FV_{\text{due}} = \text{PMT} \cdot \left[\frac{(1 + i)^n - 1}{i} \right] \cdot (1 + i)
\]
This is equivalent to:
\[
FV_{\text{due}} = FV_{\text{ordinary}} \cdot (1 + i)
\]<br><br>
3. Present Value of an Annuity Due
\[
PV_{\text{due}} = \text{PMT} \cdot \left[\frac{1 - (1 + i)^{-n}}{i} \right] \cdot (1 + i)
\]
Again:
\[
PV_{\text{due}} = PV_{\text{ordinary}} \cdot (1 + i)
\]  <br><br>
4. Solving Annuity Due Problems
   * Identify whether payments are made at the beginning (annuity due) or end (ordinary annuity) of each period.
   * Determine:
      * \( i \): periodic interest rate
      * \( n \): number of payment periods
      * \( \text{PMT} \): periodic payment
   * Use the correct formula for present or future value.
   * Multiply by \( (1 + i) \) if using ordinary annuity formulas to adjust for annuity due.  <br><br>

1. **Video: [Deferred Annuities](https://youtu.be/S5UgF1tzz6s)**  
A **deferred annuity** is an annuity where payments begin after a delay or deferment period.  
Key Points:
   * Payments start after a set number of periods.
   * Present value is calculated in two steps:
      * Find the present value at the time just before the first payment.
      * Discount that value back to today.
   * Applies to both ordinary annuities and annuities due.  <br><br>
2. **Video: [Perpetuities](https://youtu.be/CNq74zq-Jns)**  
A **perpetuity** is a series of equal payments made at regular intervals that continue indefinitely.  
Formula:
\[
PV = \frac{\text{PMT}}{i}, \quad \text{where } i > 0
\]  
Key Points:
   * No maturity — payments go on forever.
   * Present value is finite as long as \( i > 0 \).  <br><br>
3. A **constant growth annuity** is an annuity where the payments grow at a constant rate \( g \) per period.  
Formula:
\[
PV = \text{PMT}_1 \cdot \frac{1 - (1+g)^n(1+i)^{-n}}{i-g}
\]
\[
FV = \text{PMT}_1 \cdot \frac{(1+i)^n- (1+g)^n}{i-g}
\]
where:
   * \( \text{PMT}_1 \) is the first payment.
   * \( i \) is the interest rate per period.
   * \( g \) is the growth rate of the payments.
   * \( n \): the number of periods.  
Key Points:
   * Payments increase over time: \( \text{PMT}_1, \text{PMT}_1(1+g), \text{PMT}_1(1+g)^2, \dots \)
   * This formula assumes that payments are made at the \textbf{end of each period}, and that \( i > g \). <br><br>

5. **Video: [Loan Amortization Schedules](https://youtu.be/vdxdyhyXa8Q)**  
**Video: [Mortgages](https://youtu.be/tZpRI_6_Og0)**  
An **amortization table** shows how a loan is repaid over time through regular periodic payments. Each payment consists of both interest and principal components.  
Purpose
   * To track how much of each payment goes toward interest vs. principal.
   * To monitor the remaining loan balance after each payment.
   * To understand the cost of borrowing over time.  
   
Key Components of an Amortization Table

   * Payment Number (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ..., \( n \))
   * Payment Amount (fixed for a level-payment loan)
   * Interest Portion = Current balance \( \times \) periodic interest rate
   * Principal Portion = Total payment \( - \) interest
   * Remaining Balance = Previous balance \( - \) principal paid   
   
Important Notes

   * The interest portion decreases over time.
   * The principal portion increases over time.
   * The loan is fully paid off at the end of the amortization period.
   * Total interest paid can be significant, especially for long-term loans.  <br><br>
