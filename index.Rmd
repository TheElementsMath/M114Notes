This textbook has been prepared as a companion resource for students enrolled in Business Mathematics at Okanagan College. It is designed to support, not replace, the lecture material delivered in class. While every effort has been made to ensure that the content presented here is accurate and helpful, students are reminded that this resource is not a comprehensive or final source of information. Instead, it should be used alongside classroom instruction, assigned readings, and, most importantly, the official textbook: Business Mathematics by Hobart.

The material in this book covers a broad range of fundamental topics essential to understanding and applying mathematics in a business context. Beginning with a review of basic algebra, the book develops the mathematical skills needed to approach problems in supply and demand economics, cost-volume-profit (CVP) analysis, and merchandising. As students progress, they will explore the time value of money, including calculations involving both simple and compound interest. From there, the book moves into more advanced financial topics such as annuities and mortgages, offering step-by-step procedures and practical examples to illustrate how these concepts apply in real-world business settings.

Each section is written with the aim of being accessible and clear. Wherever possible, examples are contextualized within realistic business scenarios to help students understand not just how to perform calculations, but why they matter in decision-making processes. Practice problems are provided throughout to reinforce learning and encourage independent problem-solving.

Despite the care taken in preparing this resource, students are cautioned that this document may contain errors or omissions. It is not a substitute for professional instruction, nor should it be considered an authoritative source on its own. The official course textbook remains the primary source for course content and should be consulted regularly.

This resource is offered in the spirit of academic support. It is our hope that it will help students build confidence, develop analytical skills, and better understand the mathematical foundations of business decision-making.
