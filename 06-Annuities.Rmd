##  Lecture 13:  Annuity Basics {.unnumbered}

###  Learning Outcomes: {-}

1. Define an \textbf{ordinary simple annuity} and identify the key components of an ordinary simple annuity:
     * Payment amount (PMT)
     * Interest rate per period (\( i \))
     * Number of payment periods (\( n \))
     * Present value (PV)
     * Future value (FV)
2. Calculate the \textbf{future value} of an ordinary simple annuity using the formula:
    \[
    FV = PMT \left( \frac{(1 + i)^n - 1}{i} \right)
    \]
3. Calculate the \textbf{present value} of an ordinary simple annuity using the formula:
    \[
    PV = PMT \left( \frac{1 - (1 + i)^{-n}}{i} \right)
    \]
4. Interpret the financial meaning of present and future values in real-world contexts, such as loans, savings plans, and retirement funds.
5. Use financial technology tools (e.g., calculators or spreadsheets) to compute annuity values accurately and efficiently.

1. **Video: [Ordinary Simple Annuities](https://youtu.be/QSn8-A0wNZo)**  
An **ordinary simple annuity** is a series of equal payments made at regular intervals, where:
   * Payments are made at the end of each period.
   * Interest is calculated using simple interest or consistent compound interest rates.  <br><br>
2. **Video: [Present Value and Future Value](https://youtu.be/UGp2LF-J0Mo)**  
The present value (PV) and future value (FV) of an ordinary annuity are given by:
    \[
    PV = PMT \left( \frac{1 - (1 + i)^{-n}}{i} \right)
    \]
    \[
    FV = PMT \left( \frac{(1 + i)^n - 1}{i} \right)
    \] where:
   * \( PMT \): periodic payment
   * \( i = \frac{r}{m} \): interest rate per period
   * \( n = m \cdot t \): total number of payments
   * Used to find the accumulated value of all payments at the beginning or end of the term. <br><br>
3. Steps for Solving Annuity Problems:
   * Identify whether you're solving for FV or PV.
   * Determine \( PMT \), \( r \), \( m \), \( t \), and calculate \( i \) and \( n \).
   * Substitute known values into the appropriate formula.
   * Solve using a calculator or algebraically.
Assumptions:
   * Interest rate remains constant over the term.
   * Payments are equal and made at regular intervals.
   * Compounding matches the payment frequency.  <br><br>

5. **Video: [Calculating $PMT$](https://youtu.be/WV62y3hfJm03)**  
When the PV or FV of an annuity is known, you can calculate the PMT using the formulas below.
When **Future Value** is known:
    \[
    PMT = \frac{FV \cdot i}{(1 + i)^n - 1}
    \]
When **Present Value** is known:
    \[
    PMT = \frac{PV \cdot i}{1 - (1 + i)^{-n}}
    \]  <br><br>
2. **Video: [Calculating $n$](https://youtu.be/K-wqThNzu2A)**  
When the PV or FV of an annuity is known, you can calculate the $n$ using the formulas below.
When **Future Value** is known:
    \[
    n = \frac{\ln\left(\frac{FV \cdot i}{PMT} + 1\right)}{\ln(1 + i)}
    \]
When **Present Value** is known:
    \[
    n = \frac{-\ln\left(1-\frac{i \cdot PV}{PMT}\right)}{\ln(1 + i)}
    \]
   * \(i\) is the periodic interest rate: \( i = \frac{r}{m} \), where \(r\) is the annual nominal interest rate, and \(m\) is the number of compounding periods per year.
   * \(n\) is the total number of payments: \( n = \text{years} \times m \)

Lecture material for this class come from Sections 6.1, 6.4, and 6.5 and can be found below.  This material is considered review material and so it is not covered in depth.


1. **Video: [Equivalent Rates](https://youtu.be/-m7XgzLWk2g)**  
An **equivalent interest rate** is a rate that gives the same future value as another rate but is compounded at a different frequency. An equivalent periodic interest rate is given by \( i_2 = \left(1 + i_1\right)^{m_1/m_2} - 1 \).  <br><br>
2. **Video: [Ordinary General Annuities](https://youtu.be/8KY9aTEcZog)**  
An **ordinary general annuity** is a financial arrangement where equal payments (PMTs) are made at the end of each period, but the payment period and the interest compounding period do not match.
   * Payments are made at the end of each payment interval.
   * The payment interval differs from the interest conversion period.
   * The interest rate must be converted to match the payment frequency.  
Key definitions:  
      * \( i_1 \): interest rate per compounding period
      * \( m_1 \): number of compounding periods per year
      * \( m_2 \): number of payment periods per year
      * \( i_1 = \frac{rate}{m_1} \): interest rate per compounding period
      * \( i_2 = \left(1 + i_1\right)^{m_1/m_2} - 1 \): \textbf{equivalent rate per payment period}
      * \( n \): total number of payments
      * \( \text{PMT} \): periodic payment  <br><br>
3. Steps to Solve General Annuity Problems
   * Identify the nominal annual rate \( i_1 \), compounding frequency \( m_1 \), and payment frequency \( m_2 \).
   * Compute the interest per compounding period: \( i_1 = \frac{rate}{m_1} \).
   * Convert \( i_2 \) to an equivalent payment period rate \( i_2 = \left(1 + i_1 \right)^{m_1/m_2} - 1 \).
   * Determine total number of payments \( n = \text{years} \times m_2 \).
   * Apply appropriate formula (FV or PV).  <br><br>
