1. **Video: [Simple Interest](https://youtu.be/zxGUXpDlWgg)**  
Simple interest is the interest calculated only on the principal amount, not on any interest previously earned.  Simple interest is calculated using the formula \[I = Prt,\] where:
      * \( I \) = interest earned (\$)
      * \( P \) = principal (initial investment or loan amount)
      * \( r \) = annual interest rate (in decimal form)
      * \( t \) = time (in years)

1. **Video: [Present and Future Value](https://youtu.be/rO37XyVQjW8)**  
The **future value** of a simple interest investment is the total amount an investment will grow to, including interest.  Future value is calculated using the formula \[FV = P(1 + rt),\] where:  
     * \( FV \) = future value (amount after interest)
     * \( P \) = principal (initial investment)
     * \( r \) = annual interest rate (as a decimal)
     * \( t \) = time in years <br><br>
2. The **present value** of a simple interest investments the amount that must be invested today to reach a desired future value.  Present value is calculated using the formula \[ P = \frac{FV}{1 + rt}.\] <br><br>
3. Rearranging the formula, we can find the term or rate.
   * Rate: \( r = \dfrac{FV - P}{Pt} = \dfrac{I}{Pt} \)
   * Time: \( t = \dfrac{FV - P}{Pr} = \dfrac{I}{Pr} \)  <br><br>

1. **Video: [Payment Streams](https://youtu.be/eCy0_cPgobc)**  
A **payment stream** is a series of individual payments made at different points in time.  
   * Each payment earns interest independently from the time it is deposited until the calculation date (e.g., present or future).
   * To find the \textbf{total future value} or \textbf{present value} of a payment stream:
      * Calculate the future/present value of each payment separately.
      * Add the individual values to find the total.
   * Timeline diagrams are helpful for visualizing and organizing the timing of each payment. <br><br>
2. **Video: [Equivalent Payments](https://youtu.be/0v4t_Xp7tGo)**  
Two payments are said to be **equivalent**  if they have the same value at the same point in time, considering the effect of interest.
   * To compare payments made at different times:
      * Bring both payments to the same date (using present or future value formulas).
      * Use \( FV = P(1 + rt) \) or \( P = \frac{FV}{1 + rt} \).
   * Equivalent payments are used to replace one payment with another while maintaining the same economic value.  <br><br>
3. **Video: [Systems of Equations I](https://youtu.be/ooUss4RfLHI)**  
Changing interest rates: In real-world scenarios, the interest rate may change during the investment or loan period.
   * For simple interest, calculate interest in segments:
      * Break the time into periods where each rate applies.
      * Apply simple interest separately for each period.
      * Sum the interest amounts to get the total interest.
   * Formula for each segment: \( I = Prt \)
   * Final amount: 
    \[
    FV = P + I_1 + I_2 + \ldots + I_n
    \] <br><br>
