This textbook has been prepared as a companion resource for students enrolled in Business Mathematics at Okanagan College. It is designed to support, not replace, the lecture material delivered in class. While every effort has been made to ensure that the content presented here is accurate and helpful, students are reminded that this resource is not a comprehensive or final source of information. Instead, it should be used alongside classroom instruction, assigned readings, and, most importantly, the official textbook: Business Mathematics by Hobart.

The material in this book covers a broad range of fundamental topics essential to understanding and applying mathematics in a business context. Beginning with a review of basic algebra, the book develops the mathematical skills needed to approach problems in supply and demand economics, cost-volume-profit (CVP) analysis, and merchandising. As students progress, they will explore the time value of money, including calculations involving both simple and compound interest. From there, the book moves into more advanced financial topics such as annuities and mortgages, offering step-by-step procedures and practical examples to illustrate how these concepts apply in real-world business settings.

Each section is written with the aim of being accessible and clear. Wherever possible, examples are contextualized within realistic business scenarios to help students understand not just how to perform calculations, but why they matter in decision-making processes. Practice problems are provided throughout to reinforce learning and encourage independent problem-solving.

Despite the care taken in preparing this resource, students are cautioned that this document may contain errors or omissions. It is not a substitute for professional instruction, nor should it be considered an authoritative source on its own. The official course textbook remains the primary source for course content and should be consulted regularly.

This resource is offered in the spirit of academic support. It is our hope that it will help students build confidence, develop analytical skills, and better understand the mathematical foundations of business decision-making.

  Ratios are used to compare multiple quantities. They can be expressed: (a) using a colon, (b) as a fraction, (c) as a decimal, and (d) as a percentage.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Ratios:} A comparison between two quantities using division.\\
    Example: A ratio of 3 to 2 can be written as \(3:2\), \(\frac{3}{2}\), or ``3 to 2''.
  \item
    \textbf{Rates:} A specific type of ratio comparing quantities with different units.\\
    Example: A car travels 60 miles in 2 hours, so the rate is \(\frac{60 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 30 \text{ miles/hour}\).
  \item
    \textbf{Fractions:} Express part of a whole as a ratio of two numbers (numerator and denominator).\\
    Example: \(\frac{1}{4}\) means 1 part out of 4 equal parts.
  \item
    \textbf{Percentages:} A fraction with a denominator of 100. Expresses how many parts out of 100.\\
    Example: \(25\% = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
  \item
    \textbf{Decimals:} A way of expressing fractions and percentages using powers of 10.\\
    Example: \(0.5 = \frac{1}{2} = 50\%\)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Video: \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9YKlxowu68}{Taxes}}\\
  \textbf{Video: \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChgppEgOYc0}{Exchange Rates}}\\
  Ratios, rates and proportions have many different applications. They allow us to compare quantities, scale values, and interpret data in meaningful ways.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Ratios in Simplest Integer Form:} In many contexts, we prefer to express ratios using whole numbers for simplicity and clarity.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Example: A recipe that uses 2 parts sugar to 3 parts flour can be written as the ratio \(2:3\).
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Ratios with a term of 1:} It is often helpful to express a ratio with one of the terms as 1 to make comparisons easier.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Example: If the ratio of students to teachers is \(24:1\), it means there are 24 students per teacher.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Multiple Ratios or Rates in One Situation:} Some problems involve more than two quantities or rates that must be compared simultaneously.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Example: A mixture of paint may require a ratio of red : blue : white = \(3:2:5\).\\
    \item
      In finance, one might compare exchange rates between three currencies: USD to EUR, EUR to GBP, and USD to GBP.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Real-World Applications:} Currency, Tax, and Conversions: Ratios and rates are commonly used in practical calculations such as:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Exchange Rates: Converting currencies (e.g., \(1 \text{ USD} = 0.92 \text{ EUR}\)).
    \item
      Taxes and Discounts: Applying percentage increases or decreases to prices (e.g., adding 15\% tax, taking off 20\% discount).
    \item
      Unit Conversions: Converting between units using rates (e.g., \(1 \text{ inch} = 2.54 \text{ cm}\)).

  There are several assumptions that are typically made in a perfectly competitive microeconomic market.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Rational Behavior:} Individuals are rational and aim to maximize their utility or profit.
  \item
    \textbf{Profit Maximization:} Firms choose output levels to maximize profit, typically where marginal cost equals marginal revenue.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Perfect Information: All agents have full and accurate information for decision-making.
    \item
      Ceteris Paribus: All other factors are held constant when analyzing a change in one variable.
    \item
      Perfect Competition: Many buyers and sellers, identical products, no market power, and free market entry/exit.\\
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{No Externalities:} All costs and benefits are internal to market participants; no spillover effects.
  \end{itemize}
\item

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Upward Sloping:} The supply curve generally slopes upward, indicating that higher prices incentivize producers to supply more.
  \item
    \textbf{Movement Along the Curve:} Caused by a change in the price of the good itself. This reflects a change in quantity supplied.
  \item
    \textbf{Short Run vs.~Long Run:} In the short run, some inputs are fixed; in the long run, all inputs are variable, leading to a potentially more elastic supply.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Video: \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUPm2tMCbGE&list=PL-uRhZ_p-BM49QD09RNNJItpiiMGP4GUI}{The Basics of the Demand Curve}}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Downward Sloping:} The demand curve typically slopes downward, indicating that as the price of a good decreases, the quantity demanded increases.
  \item
    \textbf{Movement Along the Curve:} Caused by a change in the price of the good itself. This reflects a change in quantity demanded, not demand.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Video: \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eZcPs9z9OA}{Excesses and Surplusses}}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Shortage (Excess Demand):} Occurs when the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied at a given price.\\
  \item
    \textbf{Caused by Price Below Equilibrium:} If the market price is set below the equilibrium price, demand increases and supply decreases, creating a shortage.\\
  \item
    \textbf{Upward Pressure on Price:} In a shortage, consumers compete for limited goods, pushing prices upward toward equilibrium.
  \item
    \textbf{Surplus (Excess Supply):} Occurs when the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded at a given price.
  \item
    \textbf{Caused by Price Above Equilibrium:} If the market price is set above the equilibrium price, supply increases and demand decreases, creating a surplus.
  \item
    \textbf{Downward Pressure on Price:} In a surplus, sellers lower prices to clear excess inventory, moving the market toward equilibrium.
  \item
    \textbf{Market Forces Restore Equilibrium:} In a competitive market, shortages and surpluses are typically temporary, as price adjustments lead the market back to equilibrium.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Shift vs.~Movement:} A shift refers to a change in the entire supply or demand curve, while a movement refers to a change along the curve due to a price change.
  \item
    \textbf{Demand Curve Shifts:} Occur when a non-price determinant of demand changes. These include:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Income: Increases in income shift the demand for normal goods right and for inferior goods left.
    \item
      Prices of Related Goods:

      \begin{itemize}
      \tightlist
      \item
        Substitutes: An increase in the price of one increases demand for the other.
      \item
        Complements: An increase in the price of one decreases demand for the other.
      \end{itemize}
    \item
      Tastes and Preferences: Favorable changes shift demand right.
    \item
      Expectations: Expectations of future price increases can raise current demand.
    \item
      Number of Buyers: More buyers increase market demand.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Supply Curve Shifts:} Occur when a non-price determinant of supply changes. These include:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Input Prices: Lower input costs shift supply right; higher costs shift it left.
    \item
      Technology: Improvements shift supply right by increasing efficiency.
    \item
      Expectations: If future prices are expected to rise, current supply may decrease.
    \item
      Number of Sellers: More sellers shift supply right.
    \item
      Government Policies: Taxes, subsidies, and regulations can shift supply.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Effect on Equilibrium:}

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Demand Increase: Raises equilibrium price and quantity.
    \item
      Demand Decrease: Lowers equilibrium price and quantity.

  \textbf{Video: \href{https://youtu.be/NBrUqBwk5sE}{Trade Discounts}}\\
  The net price is the result of reducing the list price by the trade discount.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{List Price (Marked Price):} The original price of a product before any discounts are applied. This is the price set by the manufacturer or seller.
  \item
    \textbf{Trade Discount:} A percentage reduction from the list price offered by the seller to buyers, often based on quantities purchased or buyer relationships. It is not usually recorded in the books.
  \item
    \textbf{Net Price:} The actual amount the buyer pays after the trade discount is applied. It is calculated as:
    \[ \text{Net Price} = \text{List Price} \times (1 - \text{Trade Discount}) \]
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Video: \href{https://youtu.be/IXx3Ix2rr8Y}{Markups}}\\
  To ensure the business covers its operating expenses and earns a profit, it adds a markup to the cost.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Cost:} The total expenditure incurred in producing or purchasing a product. This includes materials, labor, and other direct expenses.
  \item
    \textbf{Markup:} The amount added to the cost to determine the selling price. Markup covers both profit and overhead (indirect costs such as rent, utilities, administrative expenses).

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      \textbf{Overhead:} Indirect costs of operating the business, not directly tied to a specific product.
    \item
      \textbf{Profit:} The financial gain remaining after all expenses have been covered.

      \begin{itemize}
      \tightlist
      \item
        Markup is given by: \[ \text{Markup} = \text{Overhead} + \text{Profit}.\]
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Selling Price:} The final price at which the product is sold to customers. It includes both the cost and the markup. It can be expressed as:
    \begin{align*}
     \text{Selling Price} &= \text{Cost} + \text{Markup}\\
     \text{Selling Price} &= \text{Cost} + \text{Overhead} + \text{Profit}.
     \end{align*}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Video: \href{https://youtu.be/GfI57rP47R4}{Markdowns}}\\
  The sale price is a reduced form of the selling price, directly influenced by the markdown rate.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Rate of Markdown:} The percentage reduction applied to the selling price to encourage sales, clear inventory, or match competition. It is usually expressed as a percentage:
    \[
     \text{Rate of Markdown} = \frac{\text{Selling Price} - \text{Sale Price}}{\text{Selling Price}} \times 100\%
     \]
  \item
    \textbf{Sale Price:} The final price paid by the customer after the markdown is applied. It can be calculated as:
    \[
     \text{Sale Price} = \text{Selling Price} \times (1 - \text{Markdown Rate})
     \]
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Markup on Cost vs.~Gross Profit Margin.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Rate of Markup on Cost:} This measures the percentage increase from the cost price to the selling price. It tells how much profit is made based on the cost of the item. The formula is:
    \[
     \text{Markup Rate (on Cost)} = \frac{\text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost}}{\text{Cost}} \times 100\%
     \]
  \item
    \textbf{Gross Profit Margin (Rate of Markup on Selling Price):} This measures the profit as a percentage of the selling price. It reflects how much of each dollar of sales is profit before deducting operating expenses. The formula is:
    \[
     \text{Gross Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost}}{\text{Selling Price}} \times 100\%
     \]
  \item
    Key Difference:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      The markup rate is based on the cost, while the gross profit margin is based on the selling price.
    \item
      For the same product, the markup rate will always be higher than the gross profit margin.

  \textbf{Video: \href{https://youtu.be/HLUDkVUHNwM}{Equivalent Payments and Payment Streams}}\\
  A \textbf{payment stream} is a series of cash flows (payments or deposits) made at regular or irregular intervals over time. These are often used in loan payments, investments, or savings plans.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Each payment may earn interest depending on when it is made and when it is evaluated.
  \item
    Time diagrams are useful for visualizing and organizing payment streams.
  \item
    Payment streams can be evaluated using the concept of future value or present value by summing each individual amount's value at the chosen focal date.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Equivalent payments} are payments made at different times that have the same value when brought to a common point in time using interest calculations.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Payments are equivalent if their present or future values are equal at a given focal date.
  \item
    Used to simplify or compare payment schedules.
    Steps:
  \item
    Choose a focal date.
  \item
    Convert each payment to its value at the focal date using simple or compound interest.
  \item
    Equate values and solve for unknowns (e.g., payment amount, date, interest rate).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  In some financial problems, the interest rate changes at specific intervals during the term of the investment or loan.\\
  Approach:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Split the time period into segments where each rate applies.
  \item
    Apply the interest formula separately for each segment.
  \item
    Use the output of one period as the input (principal) for the next.
    Formula:
    \[
    FV = PV \cdot (1 + i_1)^{n_1} \cdot (1 + i_2)^{n_2} \cdots (1 + i_k)^{n_k}
    \]
    Where:
  \item
    \(i_k\) is the periodic interest rate during segment \(k\)
  \item
    \(n_k\) is the number of periods for rate \(i_k\)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The \textcolor{red}{Continuous compounding} assumes interest is being added at every possible instant. It represents the mathematical limit of compounding frequency.

  \textbf{Video: \href{https://youtu.be/-m7XgzLWk2g}{Equivalent Rates}}\\
  An \textbf{equivalent interest rate} is a rate that gives the same future value as another rate but is compounded at a different frequency. An equivalent periodic interest rate is given by \(i_2 = \left(1 + i_1\right)^{m_1/m_2} - 1\).
\item
  \textbf{Video: \href{https://youtu.be/8KY9aTEcZog}{Ordinary General Annuities}}\\

  \textbf{Video: \href{https://youtu.be/xalP41MWGSg}{Ordinary Annuities Due}}\\
  An \textbf{annuity due} is a series of equal payments made at the beginning of each period, rather than at the end (as in an ordinary annuity). This type of annuity is common in situations like rent, lease payments, and insurance premiums.
\item
  \textbf{Video: \href{https://youtu.be/knuOJ03sshA}{General Annuities Due}}\\
  Future Value of an Annuity Due
  \[
  FV_{\text{due}} = \text{PMT} \cdot \left[\frac{(1 + i)^n - 1}{i} \right] \cdot (1 + i)
  \]
  This is equivalent to:
  \[
  FV_{\text{due}} = FV_{\text{ordinary}} \cdot (1 + i)
  \]
\item
  Present Value of an Annuity Due
  \[
  PV_{\text{due}} = \text{PMT} \cdot \left[\frac{1 - (1 + i)^{-n}}{i} \right] \cdot (1 + i)
  \]
  Again:
  \[
  PV_{\text{due}} = PV_{\text{ordinary}} \cdot (1 + i)
  \]
\item
  Solving Annuity Due Problems

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Identify whether payments are made at the beginning (annuity due) or end (ordinary annuity) of each period.
  \item
    Determine:

    \begin{itemize}

    \item
      \(i\): periodic interest rate
    \item
      \(n\): number of payment periods
    \item
      \(\text{PMT}\): periodic payment
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Use the correct formula for present or future value.

  Key Points:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Payments start after a set number of periods.
  \item
    Present value is calculated in two steps:

  A \textbf{perpetuity} is a series of equal payments made at regular intervals that continue indefinitely.\\
  Formula:

  PV = \frac{\text{PMT}}{i}, \quad \text{where } i > 0
  \]\\
  Key Points:

  \begin{itemize}

  \item
    No maturity --- payments go on forever.
  \item
    Present value is finite as long as \(i > 0\).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  A \textbf{constant growth annuity} is an annuity where the payments grow at a constant rate \(g\) per period.\\
  Formula:
  \[
  PV = \text{PMT}_1 \cdot \frac{1 - (1+g)^n(1+i)^{-n}}{i-g}
  \]
  \[
  FV = \text{PMT}_1 \cdot \frac{(1+i)^n- (1+g)^n}{i-g}

  \textbf{Video: \href{https://youtu.be/tZpRI_6_Og0}{Mortgages}}\\
  An \textbf{amortization table} shows how a loan is repaid over time through regular periodic payments. Each payment consists of both interest and principal components.\\
  Purpose

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    To track how much of each payment goes toward interest vs.~principal.
  \item
    To monitor the remaining loan balance after each payment.
  \item
    To understand the cost of borrowing over time.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Key Components of an Amortization Table

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Payment Number (e.g., 1, 2, 3, \ldots, \(n\))
\item
  Payment Amount (fixed for a level-payment loan)
\item
  Interest Portion = Current balance \(\times\) periodic interest rate
\item
  Principal Portion = Total payment \(-\) interest
\item
  Remaining Balance = Previous balance \(-\) principal paid
\end{itemize}

Important Notes

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The interest portion decreases over time.
\item
  The principal portion increases over time.
\item
  The loan is fully paid off at the end of the amortization period.
