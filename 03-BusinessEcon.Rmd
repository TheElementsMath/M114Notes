   5.  The market for electric bicycles (e-bikes) has recently experienced two major changes:  (a)  Due to rising fuel prices and increased environmental awareness, more consumers are choosing e-bikes as their primary mode of transportation.  (b)  At the same time, a global shortage of lithium (a key component in e-bike batteries) has increased production costs and limited the number of e-bikes manufacturers can produce.  Using a supply and demand diagram, what happens to the equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity of e-bikes?

###  Lecture Notes: {-}

Lecture material for this class come from Section 3.2 and can be found below.  This material is considered review material and so it is not covered in depth.


1. **Video: [Trade Discounts](https://youtu.be/NBrUqBwk5sE)**  
The net price is the result of reducing the list price by the trade discount.
   * **List Price (Marked Price):**   The original price of a product before any discounts are applied. This is the price set by the manufacturer or seller.
   *  **Trade Discount:**   A percentage reduction from the list price offered by the seller to buyers, often based on quantities purchased or buyer relationships. It is not usually recorded in the books.
   *  **Net Price:**   The actual amount the buyer pays after the trade discount is applied. It is calculated as:
    \[ \text{Net Price} = \text{List Price} \times (1 - \text{Trade Discount}) \]  <br><br>
2. **Video: [Markups](https://youtu.be/IXx3Ix2rr8Y)**  
To ensure the business covers its operating expenses and earns a profit, it adds a markup to the cost.
   * **Cost:**  The total expenditure incurred in producing or purchasing a product. This includes materials, labor, and other direct expenses.
   * **Markup:**  The amount added to the cost to determine the selling price. Markup covers both profit and overhead (indirect costs such as rent, utilities, administrative expenses).
       * **Overhead:** Indirect costs of operating the business, not directly tied to a specific product.
       * **Profit:** The financial gain remaining after all expenses have been covered.
	     * Markup is given by: \[ \text{Markup} = \text{Overhead} + \text{Profit}.\]
   * **Selling Price:** The final price at which the product is sold to customers. It includes both the cost and the markup. It can be expressed as:
    \begin{align*}
    \text{Selling Price} &= \text{Cost} + \text{Markup}\\
    \text{Selling Price} &= \text{Cost} + \text{Overhead} + \text{Profit}.
    \end{align*} <br><br>
3. **Video: [Markdowns](https://youtu.be/GfI57rP47R4)**  
The sale price is a reduced form of the selling price, directly influenced by the markdown rate.  
   * **Rate of Markdown:** The percentage reduction applied to the selling price to encourage sales, clear inventory, or match competition. It is usually expressed as a percentage:
    \[
    \text{Rate of Markdown} = \frac{\text{Selling Price} - \text{Sale Price}}{\text{Selling Price}} \times 100\%
    \]
   *  **Sale Price:** The final price paid by the customer after the markdown is applied. It can be calculated as:
    \[
    \text{Sale Price} = \text{Selling Price} \times (1 - \text{Markdown Rate})
    \]  <br><br>
5. Markup on Cost vs. Gross Profit Margin. 
   *  **Rate of Markup on Cost:**  This measures the percentage increase from the cost price to the selling price. It tells how much profit is made based on the cost of the item. The formula is:
    \[
    \text{Markup Rate (on Cost)} = \frac{\text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost}}{\text{Cost}} \times 100\%
    \]
   *  **Gross Profit Margin (Rate of Markup on Selling Price):**  This measures the profit as a percentage of the selling price. It reflects how much of each dollar of sales is profit before deducting operating expenses. The formula is:
    \[
    \text{Gross Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost}}{\text{Selling Price}} \times 100\%
    \]
   * Key Difference:
       * The markup rate is based on the cost, while the gross profit margin is based on the selling price.
       * For the same product, the markup rate will always be higher than the gross profit margin.

###  Lecture Notes: {-}

Lecture material for this class come from Sections 3.3 and can be found below.  This material is considered review material and so it is not covered in depth.


1. **Video: [Profit Functions](https://youtu.be/c5i7FsLeDk8)**
   *  **Fixed Costs (FC):** Fixed costs are costs that do not change with output.
	 *  **Total Variable Costs (TVC):** Total variable costs are costs that change as output changes.
	 *  **Variable Costs Per Unit (VC):** Variable costs per unit are the amount that costs increase when we increase output by 1 unit.
	 *  **Total Costs (TC):** The sum of fixed costs and variable costs \[ \text{Total Cost} = FC + TVC\]
	 *  **Profit Function:**
	    \begin{align*}
    \text{Profit} &= \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \\
	&= (P \cdot Q) - (FC + TVC)\\
	&= P \cdot Q - VC \cdot Q - FC\\
	&= (P-VC) \cdot Q - FC
    \end{align*}
    where \( P \) = price per unit, \( Q \) = quantity sold, \( FC \) = fixed costs,  \( VC \) = variable cost per unit, and \( TVC \) = total variable costs. <br><br>
2. **Video: [Contribution Margin/ Rate](https://youtu.be/RMwndvVD894)**  
      * **Contribution Margin:**  The amount each unit contributes to covering fixed costs and generating profit.
    \[
    \text{Contribution Margin} = P - VC
    \]
      *  **Contribution Rate (or Ratio):** The proportion of each sales dollar that contributes to covering fixed costs and profit.
    \[
    \text{Contribution Rate} = \frac{P - VC}{P} = \frac{\text{Contribution Margin}}{\text{Selling Price}}
    \]  <br><br>
3. **Video: [Break-even Point](https://youtu.be/td4Veo3q4r4)**  
      * The level of output at which total revenue equals total costs (i.e., profit is zero): 
    \[
    \text{Break-even Quantity} = \frac{FC}{\text{Contribution Margin per Unit}}
    \] <br><br>
4. The shutdown point is the output level where the contribution margin is 0.  The level of output where price equals the variable cost per unit (VC). If price falls below VC, the firm should shut down in the short run. 
    \[
    \text{Shutdown Point: } CM < 0
    \]
    \[
    \text{Shutdown Point: } P < VC
    \] <br><br>

###  Lecture Notes: {-}

Lecture material for this class come from Sections 3.1 and 3.4 and can be found below.  This material is considered review material and so it is not covered in depth.


1. **Video: [Derivatives of Polynomials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Sv6CNuNwqo)**  
The derivative of a polynomial function gives the rate of change or slope at any point.
   * Power Rule: If \( f(x) = ax^n \), then \( f'(x) = anx^{n-1} \).
   * Example:  
        \[
        \text{If } f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^2 + 5x - 7, \quad \text{then } f'(x) = 12x^3 - 4x + 5
        \]
   * Derivatives help identify turning points, increasing/decreasing intervals, and points of inflection. <br><br>

2. **Video: [Polynomial Optimization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9M6kmgSnw8)**  
   * Optimization involves finding the maximum or minimum values of a polynomial function by identifying critical points.
   * Critical points occur where \( f'(x) = 0 \) or is undefined. <br><br>

3. **Video: [What is a Monopoly?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=146O2tCFBWs)**  
   * A monopoly is a market structure where a single firm is the sole producer of a good or service.
   * Assumptions of a monopoly:
      * Single seller with full control over supply.
      * No close substitutes for the product.
      * High barriers to entry (legal, technological, or resource-based).
      * Price maker — the firm can influence the market price by adjusting output.
   * Monopolies typically face a downward-sloping demand curve. <br><br>

4. **Video: [Profit Maximization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk8QdpJovfs)**  
   * A monopoly maximizes profit where marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC) or when the derivative of the profit function is 0.
   * Since the monopolist faces a downward-sloping demand curve, \( MR < P \).
   * Profit-maximizing output \( Q^* \) is found where:
        \[
        MR(Q^*) = MC(Q^*)
        \] or where
        \[
        \text{Profit}^{\prime} = 0
        \]	
   * Price is determined by plugging \( Q^* \) into the demand function.
   * For linear demand, profit is calculated as:
        \[
        \text{Profit} = (P - VC) \times Q^* - FC
        \] <br><br>

        \]
      * Determine the slope of the function \( f(x) = 4x^3 - x + 6 \) at \( x = 2 \).
      * Explain the significance of the derivative in understanding the behavior of polynomial functions.

   2. Monopolies
      * Define a monopoly and list at least three assumptions or characteristics of a monopolistic market.
      * Explain why a monopolist is called a “price maker.”
      * Discuss the implications of barriers to entry in a monopolistic market.

   3. Profit Maximization in a Monopoly
      * Explain the condition \( MR = MC \) in the context of monopoly profit maximization.

          * The profit function.
          * The derivative of the profit function.
          * The profit-maximizing output level \( Q^* \).
          * The corresponding price \( P^* \).
          * The maximum profit.
      * Why is marginal revenue less than price for a monopolist?
