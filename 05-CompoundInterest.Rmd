##  Lecture 10:  Present and Future Value {.unnumbered}

###  Learning Outcomes: {-}

1. Define and distinguish between \textbf{present value} and \textbf{future value} in the context of compound interest.
2. Use the compound interest formula:
    \[
    FV = PV\left(1 + i\right)^{n}
    \]
    to calculate the future value of an investment, where
   * \( FV \): future value
   * \( PV \): present value (principal)
   * \( i \): periodic interest rate (per compound period)
   * \( n \): number of compounding periods for the investment
3. Use the rearranged formula:
    \[
    PV = \dfrac{FV}{\left(1 + i\right)^{n}}
    \]
    to determine the present value required to reach a given future value.
4. Solve problems involving compound interest with annual, semi-annual, quarterly, monthly, and daily compounding frequencies.
5. Apply compound interest formulas to real-world financial scenarios such as savings accounts, investment growth, and loan balances.

###  Lecture Notes: {-}

Lecture material for this class come from Sections 5.4 -- 5.7 and can be found below.  This material is considered review material and so it is not covered in depth.


1. **Video: [Equivalent Payments and Payment Streams](https://youtu.be/HLUDkVUHNwM)**  
A **payment stream** is a series of cash flows (payments or deposits) made at regular or irregular intervals over time. These are often used in loan payments, investments, or savings plans. 
   * Each payment may earn interest depending on when it is made and when it is evaluated.
   * Time diagrams are useful for visualizing and organizing payment streams.
   * Payment streams can be evaluated using the concept of future value or present value by summing each individual amount's value at the chosen focal date. <br><br>
2. **Equivalent payments** are payments made at different times that have the same value when brought to a common point in time using interest calculations.
   * Payments are equivalent if their present or future values are equal at a given focal date.
   * Used to simplify or compare payment schedules.
Steps:
   * Choose a focal date.
   * Convert each payment to its value at the focal date using simple or compound interest.
   * Equate values and solve for unknowns (e.g., payment amount, date, interest rate).
<br><br>
3. In some financial problems, the interest rate changes at specific intervals during the term of the investment or loan.  
Approach:
   * Split the time period into segments where each rate applies.
   * Apply the interest formula separately for each segment.
   * Use the output of one period as the input (principal) for the next.
Formula:
\[
FV = PV \cdot (1 + i_1)^{n_1} \cdot (1 + i_2)^{n_2} \cdots (1 + i_k)^{n_k}
\]
Where:
   * \( i_k \) is the periodic interest rate during segment \( k \)
   * \( n_k \) is the number of periods for rate \( i_k \)
4. The \textcolor{red}{Continuous compounding} assumes interest is being added at every possible instant. It represents the mathematical limit of compounding frequency.
Formula:
\[
FV = PV \cdot e^{rt}
\]
Where:
   * \( e \approx 2.71828 \) is Euler's number
   * \( r \) is the annual nominal interest rate (in decimal)
   * \( t \) is time in years
