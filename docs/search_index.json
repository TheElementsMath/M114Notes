[["index.html", "Business Mathematics Lecture Notes ", " Business Mathematics Lecture Notes A brief introduction This textbook has been prepared as a companion resource for students enrolled in Business Mathematics at Okanagan College. It is designed to support, not replace, the lecture material delivered in class. While every effort has been made to ensure that the content presented here is accurate and helpful, students are reminded that this resource is not a comprehensive or final source of information. Instead, it should be used alongside classroom instruction, assigned readings, and, most importantly, the official textbook: Business Mathematics by Hobart. The material in this book covers a broad range of fundamental topics essential to understanding and applying mathematics in a business context. Beginning with a review of basic algebra, the book develops the mathematical skills needed to approach problems in supply and demand economics, cost-volume-profit (CVP) analysis, and merchandising. As students progress, they will explore the time value of money, including calculations involving both simple and compound interest. From there, the book moves into more advanced financial topics such as annuities and mortgages, offering step-by-step procedures and practical examples to illustrate how these concepts apply in real-world business settings. Each section is written with the aim of being accessible and clear. Wherever possible, examples are contextualized within realistic business scenarios to help students understand not just how to perform calculations, but why they matter in decision-making processes. Practice problems are provided throughout to reinforce learning and encourage independent problem-solving. Despite the care taken in preparing this resource, students are cautioned that this document may contain errors or omissions. It is not a substitute for professional instruction, nor should it be considered an authoritative source on its own. The official course textbook remains the primary source for course content and should be consulted regularly. This resource is offered in the spirit of academic support. It is our hope that it will help students build confidence, develop analytical skills, and better understand the mathematical foundations of business decision-making.

This material is considered review material and so it is not covered in depth. Video: Percentages Video: Ratios Video: Proportions Ratios are used to compare multiple quantities. They can be expressed: (a) using a colon, (b) as a fraction, (c) as a decimal, and (d) as a percentage. Ratios: A comparison between two quantities using division. Example: A ratio of 3 to 2 can be written as \\(3:2\\), \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\), or “3 to 2”. Rates: A specific type of ratio comparing quantities with different units. Example: A car travels 60 miles in 2 hours, so the rate is \\(\\frac{60 \\text{ miles}}{2 \\text{ hours}} = 30 \\text{ miles/hour}\\). Fractions: Express part of a whole as a ratio of two numbers (numerator and denominator). Example: \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) means 1 part out of 4 equal parts. Percentages: A fraction with a denominator of 100. Expresses how many parts out of 100. Example: \\(25\\% = \\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\\) Decimals: A way of expressing fractions and percentages using powers of 10. Example: \\(0.5 = \\frac{1}{2} = 50\\%\\) Video: Taxes Video: Exchange Rates Ratios, rates and proportions have many different applications. They allow us to compare quantities, scale values, and interpret data in meaningful ways. Ratios in Simplest Integer Form: In many contexts, we prefer to express ratios using whole numbers for simplicity and clarity. Example: A recipe that uses 2 parts sugar to 3 parts flour can be written as the ratio \\(2:3\\). Ratios with a term of 1: It is often helpful to express a ratio with one of the terms as 1 to make comparisons easier. Example: If the ratio of students to teachers is \\(24:1\\), it means there are 24 students per teacher. Multiple Ratios or Rates in One Situation: Some problems involve more than two quantities or rates that must be compared simultaneously. Example: A mixture of paint may require a ratio of red : blue : white = \\(3:2:5\\). In finance, one might compare exchange rates between three currencies: USD to EUR, EUR to GBP, and USD to GBP. Real-World Applications: Currency, Tax, and Conversions: Ratios and rates are commonly used in practical calculations such as: Exchange Rates: Converting currencies (e.g., \\(1 \\text{ USD} = 0.92 \\text{ EUR}\\)). Taxes and Discounts: Applying percentage increases or decreases to prices (e.g., adding 15% tax, taking off 20% discount). Unit Conversions: Converting between units using rates (e.g., \\(1 \\text{ inch} = 2.54 \\text{ cm}\\)). Lecture Problems: Percentages Calculate 175% of $500. 65% of what amount is $85? The tax rate is 8.25%. How much tax is required for a purchase of $450? Click here for the solution The accounting, mathematics and economics departments have 10, 14 and 8 employees respectively.

There are several assumptions that are typically made in a perfectly competitive microeconomic market. Rational Behavior: Individuals are rational and aim to maximize their utility or profit. Profit Maximization: Firms choose output levels to maximize profit, typically where marginal cost equals marginal revenue. Perfect Information: All agents have full and accurate information for decision-making. Ceteris Paribus: All other factors are held constant when analyzing a change in one variable. Perfect Competition: Many buyers and sellers, identical products, no market power, and free market entry/exit. No Externalities: All costs and benefits are internal to market participants; no spillover effects. Video: The Basics of the Supply Curve Upward Sloping: The supply curve generally slopes upward, indicating that higher prices incentivize producers to supply more. Movement Along the Curve: Caused by a change in the price of the good itself. This reflects a change in quantity supplied. Short Run vs. Long Run: In the short run, some inputs are fixed; in the long run, all inputs are variable, leading to a potentially more elastic supply. Video: The Basics of the Demand Curve Downward Sloping: The demand curve typically slopes downward, indicating that as the price of a good decreases, the quantity demanded increases. Movement Along the Curve: Caused by a change in the price of the good itself. This reflects a change in quantity demanded, not demand. Video: Excesses and Surplusses Shortage (Excess Demand): Occurs when the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied at a given price. Caused by Price Below Equilibrium: If the market price is set below the equilibrium price, demand increases and supply decreases, creating a shortage. Upward Pressure on Price: In a shortage, consumers compete for limited goods, pushing prices upward toward equilibrium. Surplus (Excess Supply): Occurs when the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded at a given price. Caused by Price Above Equilibrium: If the market price is set above the equilibrium price, supply increases and demand decreases, creating a surplus. Downward Pressure on Price: In a surplus, sellers lower prices to clear excess inventory, moving the market toward equilibrium. Market Forces Restore Equilibrium: In a competitive market, shortages and surpluses are typically temporary, as price adjustments lead the market back to equilibrium. Video: Equilibrium Price and Quantity Video: Shocks to Equilibrium Shift vs. Movement: A shift refers to a change in the entire supply or demand curve, while a movement refers to a change along the curve due to a price change. Demand Curve Shifts: Occur when a non-price determinant of demand changes. These include: Income: Increases in income shift the demand for normal goods right and for inferior goods left. Prices of Related Goods: Substitutes: An increase in the price of one increases demand for the other. Complements: An increase in the price of one decreases demand for the other. Tastes and Preferences: Favorable changes shift demand right. Expectations: Expectations of future price increases can raise current demand. Number of Buyers: More buyers increase market demand. Supply Curve Shifts: Occur when a non-price determinant of supply changes. These include: Input Prices: Lower input costs shift supply right; higher costs shift it left. Technology: Improvements shift supply right by increasing efficiency. Expectations: If future prices are expected to rise, current supply may decrease. Number of Sellers: More sellers shift supply right. Government Policies: Taxes, subsidies, and regulations can shift supply. Effect on Equilibrium: Demand Increase: Raises equilibrium price and quantity. Demand Decrease: Lowers equilibrium price and quantity. Supply Increase: Lowers equilibrium price and raises quantity. Supply Decrease: Raises equilibrium price and lowers quantity. Lecture Problems: Suppose the market demand and supply for a certain good are given by the following equations: \\[\\begin{align*} Q_D &amp;= 100 - 2P \\quad (Demand) \\\\ Q_S &amp;= 20 + 3P \\quad (Supply) \\end{align*}\\] Where: \\(Q_D\\) is the quantity demanded, \\(Q_S\\) is the quantity supplied, \\(P\\) is the price of the good. Find the equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity in this market. Click here for the solution Suppose the market demand and supply for a product are given by the following equations: \\[\\begin{align*} Q_D &amp;= 80 - 2P \\quad (Demand) \\\\ Q_S &amp;= 20 + 3P \\quad (Supply) \\end{align*}\\] Assume the current market price is \\(P = 10\\). Calculate the quantity demanded and quantity supplied at this price. Is the market experiencing a shortage, a surplus, or is it in equilibrium? Based on your answer, what is likely to happen to the price in the next period? Click here for the solution A foodborne illness outbreak reduces consumer confidence in a particular brand of lettuce. What happens to the for that lettuce brand? What is the likely market outcome for price and quantity? Click here for the solution Due to a surge in health consciousness, consumers increasingly prefer plant-based protein, leading to an increase in the demand for tofu. At the same time, technological improvements reduce production costs, increasing the supply of tofu. Illustrate the shifts in both the demand and supply curves on a graph.

The price of wine has decreased recently, what effect does this have on your fruit and wine platter sales? Click here for the solution The market for electric bicycles (e-bikes) has recently experienced two major changes: (a) Due to rising fuel prices and increased environmental awareness, more consumers are choosing e-bikes as their primary mode of transportation. (b) At the same time, a global shortage of lithium (a key component in e-bike batteries) has increased production costs and limited the number of e-bikes manufacturers can produce. Using a supply and demand diagram, what happens to the equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity of e-bikes? Click here for the solution Lecture Notes: Lecture material for this class come from Section 3.2 and can be found below. This material is considered review material and so it is not covered in depth. Video: Trade Discounts The net price is the result of reducing the list price by the trade discount. List Price (Marked Price): The original price of a product before any discounts are applied. This is the price set by the manufacturer or seller. Trade Discount: A percentage reduction from the list price offered by the seller to buyers, often based on quantities purchased or buyer relationships. It is not usually recorded in the books. Net Price: The actual amount the buyer pays after the trade discount is applied. It is calculated as: \\[ \\text{Net Price} = \\text{List Price} \\times (1 - \\text{Trade Discount}) \\] Video: Markups To ensure the business covers its operating expenses and earns a profit, it adds a markup to the cost. Cost: The total expenditure incurred in producing or purchasing a product. This includes materials, labor, and other direct expenses. Markup: The amount added to the cost to determine the selling price. Markup covers both profit and overhead (indirect costs such as rent, utilities, administrative expenses). Overhead: Indirect costs of operating the business, not directly tied to a specific product. Profit: The financial gain remaining after all expenses have been covered. Markup is given by: \\[ \\text{Markup} = \\text{Overhead} + \\text{Profit}.\\] Selling Price: The final price at which the product is sold to customers. It includes both the cost and the markup. It can be expressed as: \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{Selling Price} &amp;= \\text{Cost} + \\text{Markup}\\\\ \\text{Selling Price} &amp;= \\text{Cost} + \\text{Overhead} + \\text{Profit}. \\end{align*}\\] Video: Markdowns The sale price is a reduced form of the selling price, directly influenced by the markdown rate. Rate of Markdown: The percentage reduction applied to the selling price to encourage sales, clear inventory, or match competition. It is usually expressed as a percentage: \\[ \\text{Rate of Markdown} = \\frac{\\text{Selling Price} - \\text{Sale Price}}{\\text{Selling Price}} \\times 100\\% \\] Sale Price: The final price paid by the customer after the markdown is applied. It can be calculated as: \\[ \\text{Sale Price} = \\text{Selling Price} \\times (1 - \\text{Markdown Rate}) \\] Markup on Cost vs. Gross Profit Margin. Rate of Markup on Cost: This measures the percentage increase from the cost price to the selling price. It tells how much profit is made based on the cost of the item. The formula is: \\[ \\text{Markup Rate (on Cost)} = \\frac{\\text{Selling Price} - \\text{Cost}}{\\text{Cost}} \\times 100\\% \\] Gross Profit Margin (Rate of Markup on Selling Price): This measures the profit as a percentage of the selling price. It reflects how much of each dollar of sales is profit before deducting operating expenses. The formula is: \\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Selling Price} - \\text{Cost}}{\\text{Selling Price}} \\times 100\\% \\] Key Difference: The markup rate is based on the cost, while the gross profit margin is based on the selling price. For the same product, the markup rate will always be higher than the gross profit margin. Lecture Problems: A product has a list price of $1,000. It is offered with two successive trade discounts of 20% and 10%. Calculate the net price after applying both trade discounts. Click here for the solution If the cost of an item is $180 and the seller applies a markup rate of 20% on cost for overhead and a 15% markup on selling price for profit, what is the selling price of the item? Click here for the solution An item originally priced at $200 is marked down by 25%. What is the sale price after the markdown? Click here for the solution A product is sold for $180 after a 20% markdown on its original selling price. If the cost of the product is $120, calculate: The original selling price before the markdown, The gross profit margin based on the sale price, The rate of markup based on the sale price. Click here for the solution A wholesaler lists a product at $500 with trade discounts of 15% and 5%. The net price after discounts is then marked up by 30% to determine the selling price. Later, the retailer applies a 10% markdown on the selling price to promote sales. If the cost to the retailer is equal to the wholesaler’s selling price, calculate: The net price after trade discounts, The retailer’s selling price after markup, The rate of markup and gross profit margin based on the original selling price, The final sale price after markdown, The total markdown, and The rate of markup and gross profit margin based on the final sale price.

Total Variable Costs (TVC): Total variable costs are costs that change as output changes. Variable Costs Per Unit (VC): Variable costs per unit are the amount that costs increase when we increase output by 1 unit. Total Costs (TC): The sum of fixed costs and variable costs \\[ \\text{Total Cost} = FC + TVC\\] Profit Function: \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{Profit} &amp;= \\text{Total Revenue} - \\text{Total Cost} \\\\ &amp;= (P \\cdot Q) - (FC + TVC)\\\\ &amp;= P \\cdot Q - VC \\cdot Q - FC\\\\ &amp;= (P-VC) \\cdot Q - FC \\end{align*}\\] where \\(P\\) = price per unit, \\(Q\\) = quantity sold, \\(FC\\) = fixed costs, \\(VC\\) = variable cost per unit, and \\(TVC\\) = total variable costs. Video: Contribution Margin/ Rate Contribution Margin: The amount each unit contributes to covering fixed costs and generating profit. \\[ \\text{Contribution Margin} = P - VC \\] Contribution Rate (or Ratio): The proportion of each sales dollar that contributes to covering fixed costs and profit. \\[ \\text{Contribution Rate} = \\frac{P - VC}{P} = \\frac{\\text{Contribution Margin}}{\\text{Selling Price}} \\] Video: Break-even Point The level of output at which total revenue equals total costs (i.e., profit is zero): \\[ \\text{Break-even Quantity} = \\frac{FC}{\\text{Contribution Margin per Unit}} \\] The shutdown point is the output level where the contribution margin is 0. The level of output where price equals the variable cost per unit (VC).

This material is considered review material and so it is not covered in depth. Video: Derivatives of Polynomials The derivative of a polynomial function gives the rate of change or slope at any point. Power Rule: If \\(f(x) = ax^n\\), then \\(f&#39;(x) = anx^{n-1}\\). Example: \\[ \\text{If } f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^2 + 5x - 7, \\quad \\text{then } f&#39;(x) = 12x^3 - 4x + 5 \\] Derivatives help identify turning points, increasing/decreasing intervals, and points of inflection. Video: Polynomial Optimization Optimization involves finding the maximum or minimum values of a polynomial function by identifying critical points. Critical points occur where \\(f&#39;(x) = 0\\) or is undefined. Video: What is a Monopoly? A monopoly is a market structure where a single firm is the sole producer of a good or service. Assumptions of a monopoly: Single seller with full control over supply. No close substitutes for the product. High barriers to entry (legal, technological, or resource-based). Price maker — the firm can influence the market price by adjusting output. Monopolies typically face a downward-sloping demand curve. Video: Profit Maximization A monopoly maximizes profit where marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC) or when the derivative of the profit function is 0. Since the monopolist faces a downward-sloping demand curve, \\(MR &lt; P\\). Profit-maximizing output \\(Q^*\\) is found where: \\[ MR(Q^*) = MC(Q^*) \\] or where \\[ \\text{Profit}^{\\prime} = 0 \\] Price is determined by plugging \\(Q^*\\) into the demand function. For linear demand, profit is calculated as: \\[ \\text{Profit} = (P - VC) \\times Q^* - FC \\] Lecture Problems: Derivatives of Polynomials Find the derivative of the polynomial function: \\[ f(x) = 5x^4 - 3x^3 + 2x - 7 \\] Determine the slope of the function \\(f(x) = 4x^3 - x + 6\\) at \\(x = 2\\). Explain the significance of the derivative in understanding the behavior of polynomial functions. Click here for the solution Monopolies Define a monopoly and list at least three assumptions or characteristics of a monopolistic market. Explain why a monopolist is called a “price maker.” Discuss the implications of barriers to entry in a monopolistic market. Click here for the solution Profit Maximization in a Monopoly Explain the condition \\(MR = MC\\) in the context of monopoly profit maximization.

Video: Calculating Equivalent Payments A payment stream is a series of individual payments made at different points in time. Each payment earns interest independently from the time it is deposited until the calculation date (e.g., present or future). To find the or of a payment stream: Calculate the future/present value of each payment separately. Add the individual values to find the total. Timeline diagrams are helpful for visualizing and organizing the timing of each payment. Video: Applications of SI Two payments are said to be equivalent if they have the same value at the same point in time, considering the effect of interest. To compare payments made at different times: Bring both payments to the same date (using present or future value formulas). Use \\(FV = P(1 + rt)\\) or \\(P = \\frac{FV}{1 + rt}\\). Equivalent payments are used to replace one payment with another while maintaining the same economic value. Changing interest rates: In real-world scenarios, the interest rate may change during the investment or loan period.

Video: Equivalent Payments and Payment Streams A payment stream is a series of cash flows (payments or deposits) made at regular or irregular intervals over time. These are often used in loan payments, investments, or savings plans. Each payment may earn interest depending on when it is made and when it is evaluated. Time diagrams are useful for visualizing and organizing payment streams. Payment streams can be evaluated using the concept of future value or present value by summing each individual amount’s value at the chosen focal date. Equivalent payments are payments made at different times that have the same value when brought to a common point in time using interest calculations. Payments are equivalent if their present or future values are equal at a given focal date. Used to simplify or compare payment schedules. Steps: Choose a focal date. Convert each payment to its value at the focal date using simple or compound interest. Equate values and solve for unknowns (e.g., payment amount, date, interest rate). In some financial problems, the interest rate changes at specific intervals during the term of the investment or loan. Approach: Split the time period into segments where each rate applies. Apply the interest formula separately for each segment. Use the output of one period as the input (principal) for the next. Formula: \\[ FV = PV \\cdot (1 + i_1)^{n_1} \\cdot (1 + i_2)^{n_2} \\cdots (1 + i_k)^{n_k} \\] Where: \\(i_k\\) is the periodic interest rate during segment \\(k\\) \\(n_k\\) is the number of periods for rate \\(i_k\\) The assumes interest is being added at every possible instant.

This material is considered review material and so it is not covered in depth. Video: Equivalent Rates An equivalent interest rate is a rate that gives the same future value as another rate but is compounded at a different frequency. An equivalent periodic interest rate is given by \\(i_2 = \\left(1 + i_1\\right)^{m_1/m_2} - 1\\). Video: Ordinary General Annuities An ordinary general annuity is a financial arrangement where equal payments (PMTs) are made at the end of each period, but the payment period and the interest compounding period do not match. Payments are made at the end of each payment interval. The payment interval differs from the interest conversion period. The interest rate must be converted to match the payment frequency. Key definitions: \\(i_1\\): interest rate per compounding period \\(m_1\\): number of compounding periods per year \\(m_2\\): number of payment periods per year \\(i_1 = \\frac{rate}{m_1}\\): interest rate per compounding period \\(i_2 = \\left(1 + i_1\\right)^{m_1/m_2} - 1\\): \\(n\\): total number of payments \\(\\text{PMT}\\): periodic payment Steps to Solve General Annuity Problems Identify the nominal annual rate \\(i_1\\), compounding frequency \\(m_1\\), and payment frequency \\(m_2\\). Compute the interest per compounding period: \\(i_1 = \\frac{rate}{m_1}\\). Convert \\(i_2\\) to an equivalent payment period rate \\(i_2 = \\left(1 + i_1 \\right)^{m_1/m_2} - 1\\). Determine total number of payments \\(n = \\text{years} \\times m_2\\). Apply appropriate formula (FV or PV).

Video: Ordinary Annuities Due An annuity due is a series of equal payments made at the beginning of each period, rather than at the end (as in an ordinary annuity). This type of annuity is common in situations like rent, lease payments, and insurance premiums. Video: General Annuities Due Future Value of an Annuity Due \\[ FV_{\\text{due}} = \\text{PMT} \\cdot \\left[\\frac{(1 + i)^n - 1}{i} \\right] \\cdot (1 + i) \\] This is equivalent to: \\[ FV_{\\text{due}} = FV_{\\text{ordinary}} \\cdot (1 + i) \\] Present Value of an Annuity Due \\[ PV_{\\text{due}} = \\text{PMT} \\cdot \\left[\\frac{1 - (1 + i)^{-n}}{i} \\right] \\cdot (1 + i) \\] Again: \\[ PV_{\\text{due}} = PV_{\\text{ordinary}} \\cdot (1 + i) \\] Solving Annuity Due Problems Identify whether payments are made at the beginning (annuity due) or end (ordinary annuity) of each period. Determine: \\(i\\): periodic interest rate \\(n\\): number of payment periods \\(\\text{PMT}\\): periodic payment Use the correct formula for present or future value. Multiply by \\((1 + i)\\) if using ordinary annuity formulas to adjust for annuity due.

This material is considered review material and so it is not covered in depth. Video: Deferred Annuities A deferred annuity is an annuity where payments begin after a delay or deferment period. Key Points: Payments start after a set number of periods. Present value is calculated in two steps: Find the present value at the time just before the first payment. Discount that value back to today. Applies to both ordinary annuities and annuities due. Video: Perpetuities A perpetuity is a series of equal payments made at regular intervals that continue indefinitely. Formula: \\[ PV = \\frac{\\text{PMT}}{i}, \\quad \\text{where } i &gt; 0 \\] Key Points: No maturity — payments go on forever. Present value is finite as long as \\(i &gt; 0\\). A constant growth annuity is an annuity where the payments grow at a constant rate \\(g\\) per period. Formula: \\[ PV = \\text{PMT}_1 \\cdot \\frac{1 - (1+g)^n(1+i)^{-n}}{i-g} \\] \\[ FV = \\text{PMT}_1 \\cdot \\frac{(1+i)^n- (1+g)^n}{i-g} \\] where: \\(\\text{PMT}_1\\) is the first payment. \\(i\\) is the interest rate per period. \\(g\\) is the growth rate of the payments. \\(n\\): the number of periods. Key Points: Payments increase over time: \\(\\text{PMT}_1, \\text{PMT}_1(1+g), \\text{PMT}_1(1+g)^2, \\dots\\) This formula assumes that payments are made at the , and that \\(i &gt; g\\).

The annuity earns an interest rate of 6% compounded monthly. What is the present value of the annuity (i.e., how much should the retiree invest today to receive this income stream)? Click here for the solution An investor wants to purchase a deferred perpetuity that will pay $5,000 annually, starting 8 years from today and continuing forever. The annual interest rate is 7%, compounded annually. What is the present value of this investment today? Click here for the solution Maria decides to invest in her RRSP to prepare for retirement. She contributes $6,000 at the end of each year for 20 years. The account earns an annual interest rate of 5%, compounded annually. After the 20 years of contributions, Maria stops adding money to the RRSP and allows the investment to grow with compound interest for another 10 years without any withdrawals. At the end of this 10-year accumulation period, Maria begins withdrawing $25,000 at the end of each year for her retirement. The account continues to earn 5% interest, compounded annually, during the withdrawal phase. What will be the value of Maria’s RRSP at the time she stops contributing (i.e., after 20 years)? What will be the value of the RRSP at the beginning of the withdrawal phase (i.e., after the additional 10 years of interest accumulation)? For how many years will Maria be able to withdraw $25,000 annually before the RRSP is depleted?

Video: Loan Amortization Schedules Video: Mortgages An amortization table shows how a loan is repaid over time through regular periodic payments. Each payment consists of both interest and principal components. Purpose To track how much of each payment goes toward interest vs. principal. To monitor the remaining loan balance after each payment. To understand the cost of borrowing over time. Key Components of an Amortization Table Payment Number (e.g., 1, 2, 3, …, \\(n\\)) Payment Amount (fixed for a level-payment loan) Interest Portion = Current balance \\(\\times\\) periodic interest rate Principal Portion = Total payment \\(-\\) interest Remaining Balance = Previous balance \\(-\\) principal paid Important Notes The interest portion decreases over time. The principal portion increases over time. The loan is fully paid off at the end of the amortization period. Total interest paid can be significant, especially for long-term loans.
