# Parts

You can add parts to organize one or more book chapters together. Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. 

Add a numbered part: `# (PART) Act one {-}` (followed by `# A chapter`)

Add an unnumbered part: `# (PART\*) Act one {-}` (followed by `# A chapter`)

Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: `# (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-}` (followed by `# A chapter`). Chapters in an appendix are prepended with letters instead of numbers.

You can use the methods of substitution and elimination to solve systems of equations.  
   1. Use substitution when it is easy to isolate one of the variables in one of the equations and substitute it into the other equation.
	 2. Use elimination if the coefficients in front of one of the variables is the same size in both equations.
	 3.  Either method will work for most problems and you are free to use whichever works best for you.  <br><br>
