Lecture material for this class come from Sections 7.1 and can be found below.  This material is considered review material and so it is not covered in depth.


1. **Video: [Annuities Due](https://youtu.be/xalP41MWGSg)**  
An **annuity due** is a series of equal payments made at the beginning of each period, rather than at the end (as in an ordinary annuity). This type of annuity is common in situations like rent, lease payments, and insurance premiums. <br><br>
2. **Video: [PV and FV of Annuities Due](https://youtu.be/knuOJ03sshA)**  
Future Value of an Annuity Due
\[
FV_{\text{due}} = \text{PMT} \cdot \left[\frac{(1 + i)^n - 1}{i} \right] \cdot (1 + i)
\]
This is equivalent to:
\[
FV_{\text{due}} = FV_{\text{ordinary}} \cdot (1 + i)
\]<br><br>
3. Present Value of an Annuity Due
\[
PV_{\text{due}} = \text{PMT} \cdot \left[\frac{1 - (1 + i)^{-n}}{i} \right] \cdot (1 + i)
\]
Again:
\[
PV_{\text{due}} = PV_{\text{ordinary}} \cdot (1 + i)
\]  <br><br>
4. Solving Annuity Due Problems
   * Identify whether payments are made at the beginning (annuity due) or end (ordinary annuity) of each period.
   * Determine:
      * \( i \): periodic interest rate
      * \( n \): number of payment periods
      * \( \text{PMT} \): periodic payment
   * Use the correct formula for present or future value.
   * Multiply by \( (1 + i) \) if using ordinary annuity formulas to adjust for annuity due.  <br><br>

Lecture material for this class come from Sections 7.2, 7.3, 7.4 and 7.5 and can be found below.  This material is considered review material and so it is not covered in depth.


1. **Video: [Deferred Annuities](https://youtu.be/S5UgF1tzz6s)**  
A **deferred annuity** is an annuity where payments begin after a delay or deferment period.  
Key Points:
   * Payments start after a set number of periods.
   * Present value is calculated in two steps:
      * Find the present value at the time just before the first payment.
      * Discount that value back to today.
   * Applies to both ordinary annuities and annuities due.  <br><br>
2. **Video: [Perpetuities](https://youtu.be/CNq74zq-Jns)**  
A **perpetuity** is a series of equal payments made at regular intervals that continue indefinitely.  
Formula:
\[
PV = \frac{\text{PMT}}{i}, \quad \text{where } i > 0
\]  
Key Points:
   * No maturity â€” payments go on forever.
   * Present value is finite as long as \( i > 0 \).  <br><br>
3. **Video: [Constant Growth Annuities](https://youtu.be/ooUss4RfLHI)**  
A **constant growth annuity** is an annuity where the payments grow at a constant rate \( g \) per period.  
Formula:
\[
PV = \text{PMT}_1 \cdot \frac{1 - (1+g)^n(1+i)^{-n}}{i-g}
\]
\[
FV = \text{PMT}_1 \cdot \frac{(1+i)^n- (1+g)^n}{i-g}
\]
where:
   * \( \text{PMT}_1 \) is the first payment.
   * \( i \) is the interest rate per period.
   * \( g \) is the growth rate of the payments.
   * \( n \): the number of periods.  
Key Points:
   * Payments increase over time: \( \text{PMT}_1, \text{PMT}_1(1+g), \text{PMT}_1(1+g)^2, \dots \)
   * This formula assumes that payments are made at the \textbf{end of each period}, and that \( i > g \). <br><br>
